# Diabetes-Prediction-using-KNN

This repository demonstrates the project of "Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning". This project has been created by implementing the K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. Initially, the Machine Learning model of KNN Algorithm is trained using diabetes_train dataset and later on the expected results are tested and obtained successfully. The accuracy of around 87.4 % was achieved after the successful execution of the Machine Learning Model.
